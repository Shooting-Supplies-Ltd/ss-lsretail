The latest Weihrauch is set to take the Air Rifle market by storm, it's a fantastic example of the quality German engineering Weihrauch are known for. 

The HW110 provides impressive accuracy and consistency thanks to its ballistic polymer single casting block. This increases rigidity and barrel alignment, resulting in vibration free shot release and accurate shots.

The gun comes in at 3Kg unscoped and is capable of around 220 shots per 200bar fill. 

Without a doubt one of the most accurate air rifles available today.

The [Weihrauch T](/guns/weihrauch-hw-110-t2107268) & [Weihrauch KT](/guns/weihrauch-hw-110-kt-2107116) .177 Laminate's are both avaible now.
