# **Air Rifle Licencing Petition**

As I'm sure most of you are aware, the government has been looking at reviewing the air gun licencing laws in England and Wales.

The response to the original proposals closed on February 6th, with many people and organisations writing to their MP, including BASC, the country side Alliance and the GTA (Gun Trade Association).

The GTA has now setup an online petition to oppose any further licencing of air weapons.

Please follow the link below and sign up, to stop further government restrictions on our sport.
