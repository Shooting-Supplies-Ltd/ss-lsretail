# **Benelli Raffaello Accademia**
In Store Price £2949

Benelli are well known for their ultra reliable shotguns and the Raffaello Accademia is no exception, with this semi auto they are offering something a little bit special.

The Raffaello Accademia is an exclusive semi auto shotgun, with only 1000 made, it blends tradition with innovative design and build quality.

In the Accademia, Benelli have created a unique and collectible, premium shotgun. Featuring Satin Walnut furniture and a unique engraving. The engraving is the result of a collaboration between Benelli and students of Urbino's Academy of Fine Arts.

****

The barrels of the Accademia have been treated with Benelli's B.E.S.T. finishing process which provides an exceptional finish with a brilliant stand out black and provides excellent resistance to corrosion and wear.

The inertia driven system that has been used on this gun, unlike the majority of gas operated semi autos, has been described as 'true work of engineering genius' and provides precision, strength and reliability along with offering the owner easy maintenance.

The Raffaello Accademia is a must have!
