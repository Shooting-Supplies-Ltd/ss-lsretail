Extremely well built, offering comfort, stability, and easy swing, all as a result of a range of features including the Kick Off Plus system.

The Kick Off Plus system consists of 2x dampeners and return springs, which combined, enable a reduction in recoil by up to 40%. It's a significant reduction making the gun very comfortable to shoot.

A third damper, located in the stock bolt, absorbs the impact of the slide against the stock, reducing the second recoil, muzzle jump, and vibrations caused by the movement of the slide.

The MicroCore recoil plate ensures perfect shouldering and maximum stability when shooting and allows for the possibility to adjust the stock's length to suit your requirements using the spacers provided.

The comb features Soft Comb, which is a soft insert that provides comfort against the cheek and the rubber Comfort Grip improves sensitivity and pistol grip, ensuring maximum grip even in poor weather conditions.

The Beretta also features an ultra-fast, safe loading system and new oversized cocking handle and bolt release lever.

All of these features combined make the 1301 Comp Pro the most competitive shooting platform around.
