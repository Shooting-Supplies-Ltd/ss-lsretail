# **Breaking News**

## **YOUR SPORT IS UNDER THREAT**

### **YOU NEED TO ACT NOW**

After the recent terrorist attacks the EU

the government is trying to ban .22 semi auto rifles.

It’s non shooters setting these regulations.

These bureaucrats don’t understand that restricting

law abiding shooters will not change a thing.

TERRORISTS DON’T HAVE LICENCES

**ALSO**

The campaign to ban all lead shot rumbles on.

This will affect all shotgun sports.

The Lead Ammunition Group

who advise DEFRA is in complete disarray,

more than 50% of its members have resigned,

there is no sound evidence to ban lead shot.

BASC want to ensure that lead ammunition is not banned.
