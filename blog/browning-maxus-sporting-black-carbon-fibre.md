Reliability built-in, Browning's Power Drive gas system has been designed to perform under harsh hunting and shooting conditions with a wide array of loads. These guns are supremely reliable and mostly maintenance-free as long as they are kept clean.

Performance, this Maxus Sporting model has less recoil, less muzzle jump, a faster bolt speed and a claimed 24% faster lock time than the nearest competitor. The time between pulling the trigger and being ready for the next shot is very short on this semi-auto due to its advanced trigger and firing pin system.

The years of service this gun will provide make it incredibly good value for money, and just look at that carbon fibre!
