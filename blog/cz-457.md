The barrel is cold hammer forged and 20.5" long with a ½ x 20 UNF muzzle thread and protector. CZ also say that it has a Match-type chamber.

The MTR is supplied with a clean and crisp adjustable trigger, adjustable from 1.75 to 3.37 lbs and the travel may be adjusted between 0.5-7mm.

The safety on this model has been replaced with a normal rolling lever that is positioned rear right, push forward to FIRE (red dot) and back for SAFE (white dot). On SAFE, you still get bolt operation and there’s a proper bolt release catch rear left.
