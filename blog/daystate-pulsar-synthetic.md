# **Daystate Pulsar Synthetic**

_In-Store from £1499_

The Daystate Pulsar Synthetic PCP Air Rifle is a damned good air rifle, read on to learn more.

_The Daystate Pulsar is a feat of engineering, featuring an electronic firing system providing more accuracy and consistency than ever before._

The Daystate Pulsar doesn't use the standard hammer and valve system, instead it uses a super consistent electric solenoid which reads the pressure within the air cylinder, and strikes the valve the exact amount to provide extreme consistency between shots.

The Pulsar's Synthetic stock is ergonomic and easy to handle and with a weaver rail underneath the barrel, mounting accessories such as bipods and lamps is effortless.

The Daystate Pulsar stock is fully ambidextrous—even the cocking lever can be reversed. This is also one of the safest air rifles ever, with an unprecedented array of safety systems.
