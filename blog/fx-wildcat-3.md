# ***FX Wildcat 3***

The FX Wildcat was compact before compact became a buzzword in airguns. A finely balanced and ergonomically designed bullpup that defined the generation of bullpups that have followed in its footsteps.

FX have continued this legacy by updating the Wildcat platform with the modern airgunner in mind, delivering the MKIII with a range of improvements.

### ***The FX Wildcat just got upgrades.***

This version of the FX Wildcat has received an increase to its number of shots and is no longer restricted to just 8 shots thanks to its use of the FX Side-Shot magazine, delivering more than double the shots per magazine.

FX have improved the main block by increasing the plenum size and the air flow of the rifle, while also increasing the valving. The new Wildcat block really does demonstrate what can be achieved with precision CNC engineering.

The new rear power adjuster allows for micro and macro adjustments using the same dial to the hammer spring. The rear power adjuster has 7 pre-sets for your hammer, but the actual hammer tension can be adjusted more, higher or lower, using an Allen wrench through a hole found on the 8th position of the adjuster. allowing the Wildcat MkIII hammer to be fully adjusted in harmony with the AMP regulator to allow for the full range of adjustability found in other FX rifles. 

All Wildcat MKIII rifles will also ship with FX’s new and improved STX Barrel Liners.

The two stage adjustable trigger and the adjustable AMP regulator remain on this model.
