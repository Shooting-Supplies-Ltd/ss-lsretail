# **Updated advice on shooting activities in England**


BASC has updated its advice for shooting, work on shoots and pest control in England – but not in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – following the government's latest changes to the regulations for fighting Covid-19.

This advice has been formed after discussions with the government and has been submitted to Defra for confirmation.

In line with the Prime Minister’s statement, from Wednesday 13 May, deer stalking, pest control, conservation and seasonal work on game shoots are possible so long as they meet the following requirements:

1. You may carry out these activities with those from your household group and/or one person who is not from your household group.  

2. You may travel any distance in England with people from your household group to engage in these activities but the person who is not from your household group may not travel in the same vehicle as you do.  

3. You must observe the rules on social distancing at all times.  

4. You must have the permission of the landowner before engaging in any shooting or shooting-related work on their land.  

5. Any pest control must conform to the law and the general licences.  

6. Deer management must be conducted according to the law. Roebucks are currently in season and muntjac may be managed at any time of the year.  

7. Before shooting any quarry species you should consider how the meat will be put into the food chain.  
  
There have been issues with different police forces interpreting the government's rules in different ways. If in any doubt about how your local police will react, you should contact the police before shooting, inform them that you are planning your activities within the current regulations and obtain the reference number for the call. You should also carry your certificate with you in case you are challenged by the police.
