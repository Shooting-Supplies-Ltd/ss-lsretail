The Marlin 1894 Dark is a gun that really draws your attention and whilst bearing the traditional features of a lever action rifle, its modern features really stand out from the crowd. 

The hardwood stock and fore-end feature a stealthy, webbed, matt-black finish that provides a grippy texture when holding the gun. 

Performance enhancements for the Dark series include a threaded 16.25" barrel, a paracord wrapped wild-west style big loop lever and an XS Sights 10" rail allowing for a huge range of sights to be fitted with ease. 

An adjustable ghost ring rear sight and an XS blade front sight are fitted on this model.

The trigger on the 1894 Dark should be mentioned as it's one of the best to be found on a lever action rifle, providing a lighter feel than the 4lbs 11oz that it measures, with no takeup and overtravel.
