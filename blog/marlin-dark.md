# **New Marlin Dark**

Coming Soon..

Owning one of Marlins' highly anticipated Dark Series lever-action rifles is in touching distance. The dark series range of 1894/95 stealthy, tricked out, and blacked out lever-action rifles is aiming to bring lever-action rifles back to the fore.

Designed for the modern hunter, they feature a stealthy-tough black matte parkerised finish and a black-webbed hardwood stock. With a host of performance enhancements, including a threaded barrel, big-loop lever and XS Lever Rail with ghost ring peep that also accommodates a wide variety of optics.

This is one to look out for and we shall update you as soon as they come into stock.
