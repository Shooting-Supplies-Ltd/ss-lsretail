For this model of the 500, Mossberg have teamed up with Hushpower to create a superb, yet quiet hunting gun. Whilst the silencer is not going to improve power or accuracy it does provide other benefits, no more disturbing the neighbours in built up areas and the greater concealment brings bigger hauls.

To the eye this shotgun is business-like, no fancy features here. Finished in matte black and is immune to rust and corrosion. The stock of the 500 Hushpower is made from a durable, synthetic polymer that's been textured for a sure grip no matter the weather.

Trigger pull is positive with no creep and breaks and the safety is tang-mounted and easy and instinctive to use.

All in all, there’s nothing to dislike about the Mossberg 500 Hushpower .410, essentially, it's an inexpensive, fun to shoot, and extremely durable shotgun.
