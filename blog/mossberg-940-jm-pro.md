## **Competition Ready**

The 940 JM Pro was built to compete and win, featuring a modified durable gas system to improve reliability. A redesigned piston and ring assembly, with advanced coatings to minimise carbon build up. Combined, these upgrades  allow for upto 1500 rounds between cleaning. 

The shotgun has been tuned for speed, being both quick and easy to load. The loading port, elevator and shell catch have been adapted by Miculek and Mossberg to eliminate the potential for snagging and pinching.

There is also a new slimmer hand guard that fits the hand well, which features Mossberg's patent-pending textured pattern and provides just the right level of grip. The pistol grip also has the same new texture pattern. 

The buttstock is also improved and has been designed to be tailored by the shooter, making for a perfect fit.

When all is said and done, the 940 JM Pro builds on the success of the 930 and then some. 

In summary John Raciti, senior R&D project engineer for Mossberg, explains the design intentions for the 940 JM Pro: 

“Our main design goals for the 940 were as follows: Improve the gas system to drastically increase the cleaning interval while improving the ability to cycle lighter loads with minimal break-in. Produce a shotgun that is competition-ready in every way right out of the box. Produce a shotgun that can be customized to fit users of all sizes. With the close collaboration of Jerry and Lena Miculek, we’ve achieved these goals.”
