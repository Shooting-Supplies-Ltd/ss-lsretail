The core of the rifle is a robust v-shaped two-piece aluminium chassis which provides accuracy, consistency and is a solid foundation for lasting stability and balance.  The stock, forestock and pistol grip are easily attached and detached, it is this simplicity of removing the main components that is what makes this rifle fully modular and customisable for wither hunting or precision shooting.

The hunter model (available at Shooting Supplies) is a 20", .243. Weighing in at 7.2-7.4lbs,  and has a thumbhole design. With a cold hammer forged stainless steel barrel designed to ensure consistent accuracy of sub-MOA and pre-threaded for a moderator.

The length of the pull on the stock can be adjusted with spacers (2x included) and the adjustable cheek piece has three extension settings allowing for maximum comfort and accuracy. The grip is a soft-touch leather like polymer which adds to the fantastic grip and comfort.

The extremely durable bolt has been manufactured from high grade, weather resistant stainless steel with an interchangeable handle. The bolt on this gun offers fast and smooth operation.

Other features of the Sako S20 Hunter include the picatinny rail which is machined directly as a part of the receiver and the 5 round detachable box magazine that is glass reinforced composite. The adjustable trigger is wide and comfortable and provides adjustable pull weight of 2-4kg. The trigger can also be easily adjusted either 3mm back or 4mm forward from factory settings.

The Sako S20 provides shooters a comfortable and nicely balanced future proof rifle that can be fully customised for any purpose or shooter. It is a highly recommended bit of kit.
