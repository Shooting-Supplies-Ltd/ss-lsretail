## ***Tradition meets high tech***

Schmeisser GmbH was founded by Thomas Hoff and Andreas Schumacher in 2009. The founders had accumulated over 20 years of experience designing, developing and trading firearms prior to establishing the German firearms manufacturer. One of their initial projects was the production of self-loading, semi-automatic AR-15 rifles for civilians and fully-automatic M-16 rifles for the domestic and international police and military market.

The versatile development department at Schmeisser GmbH provides public authorities with the fastest possible solutions for their specific requirements.

Schmeisser GmbH is one of four licensed NATO and Bundeswehr small arms suppliers.

Schmeisser rifles stand out from competitor products through their proper functioning, regardless of which ammunition is used.

## ***On to the rifles***

The Schmeisser Straight Pull is an even more precise straight pull repeater with a fluted, free-swinging .936 match barrel and a slim M-Lok fore-end. The dynamic trigger ensures a particularly uniform characteristic. The safety, magazine release, loading lever and slide catch are designed on both sides. Standard delivery with 10 round magazine.
