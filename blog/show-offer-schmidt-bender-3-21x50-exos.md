The 3-21x50 Exos is the latest addition to the popular Schmidt & Bender Exos line.

Due to its robust design, this high-performance rifle scope is particularly suitable for reliability under the toughest hunting conditions, such as mountain hunting, as well as for precise, sporty competition shooting.

The user-friendly locking of the new reticle quick adjustment (ASV) prevents unintentional adjustment.

The towers are designed for extreme temperatures from +70 ° C to –40 ° C and, thanks to their functional design, can be operated easily with gloves.

With our new "True Color Technology", our optics designers have developed crystal-clear image quality that is based on color-true image reproduction. This is extremely important not only to prevent premature eye fatigue but also to be able to correctly address game in poor lighting conditions.

The reticle in the second image plane with a circular, daylight-compatible red dot combines low target coverage with good visibility of the crosshairs.

The optimal magnification range of the 3-21x50 Exos makes it a versatile riflescope.
