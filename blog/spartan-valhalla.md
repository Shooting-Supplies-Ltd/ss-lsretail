# **Spartan Valhalla Bipod**

In-Store Â£399.95

We're now stocking the Spartan range of bipods including the Valhalla, a surprisingly strong, low-weight (just 373g) bipod from Spartan. Manufactured using CNC machined 7075 aliminium and carbon fibre, the [Valhalla](/products/spartan-valhalla-bipod) has been designed and developed with input from professional hunters and the military, including personnel associated with Norwegian Special Forces. 

The Valhalla is considered a heavy weight amongst its competition and is a fantastic tool that provides both value and functionality.

The bipod is sold with a mount, either M-Lok or Picatinny, and allows for quick, easy and fast attach and release. The mount attaches to your rifle, you then attach and remove the bipod itself from your mount. This system makes it painless to use the bipod with different rifles.

The Valhalla has multi positional legs with quick deploy catches and can be swapped out for a range of different sizes and lengths giving a huge amount of flexibilty for use.
