# **The Game Fair**

As I'm sure most of you are aware the Game Fair is on this weekend at Ragley Hall.

Pulling thousands of people from all over the UK, it promises to be as busy as always, especially with this fantastic weather we are having!!!

Once again Simpsons Brother gunshop will have some Tippmann Arms rifles on the shelf, including the new 12.5" barrelled Elite-S.

****

And if you fancy a plink while you are there, pop over to Double-Deuce firing range. They have an assortment of Tippmann Arms rifles for you to try. Happy shopping!!
