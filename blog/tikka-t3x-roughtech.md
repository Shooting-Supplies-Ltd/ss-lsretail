Tikka rifles are produced in Finland by Sako and go through the same testing process as their more expensive counterparts, resulting in rifles that can be relied upon for their accuracy and durability.

This model, the T3X Roughtech provides all of the features of the T3X lite combined with the Roughtech stock, giving increased grip and performance throughout all conditions. 

Muzzle break is included for reduced recoil and a fluted barrel and bolt for weight optimisation. The rifle also features an oversized bolt handle for comfortable cycling.

The T3X Roughtech has a modular stock with an interchangeable grip that also allows for angle modification, increasing comfort from all shooting positions. Tikka's new recoil pad technology is included on this rifle, reducing recoil and improving accuracy. 

The ejection port on these models has also been redesigned to make cartridge feed a breeze. 

This is a steal of a rifle, pick up your very own **Tikka T3X Roughtech 6.5 CR 24"** from Shooting Supplies for just **Â£1065**.
