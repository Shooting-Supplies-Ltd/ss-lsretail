# **Tippmann Arms Elite-S 12.5" Barrel**

So we finally have the third model of the Tippmann Arms rifle ready for sale in the UK.

The new Elite-S has the same quality floating hand guard of the Elite, just this one has an extremely pointable 12.5" barrel and the hand guard is 9" to keep the weight down at the front.

See picture below of an Elite-S with an ATEC wave moderator attached.
