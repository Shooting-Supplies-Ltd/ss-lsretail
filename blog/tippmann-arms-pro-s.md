# **Tippmann Arms M4 Pro-S**

The newest model to the Tippmann family is the **Tippmann Arms** **Pro-S**.

The Pro-S was recently launched in the UK at the British shooting show and was also selected as our [Gun of the Week](https://www.shootingsuppliesltd.co.uk/gun-of-the-week-tippmann-pro-s-19-07-19/).

As far as looks go, you would struggle to tell the difference between the Pro-S and the Elite-S. However the Pro-S has a polymer handguard, instead of the Aluminium version on the Elite.

This brings the weight of the Rifle down to under 5lbs, making it super fast!

The Pro-S also features a Gen 2 grip for better handling and a silver nickel coated bolt for extra durability.

Just like the other models of the Tippmann M4 family, the Pro-S comes with a hard case. However it comes with two 25 round magazines as standard.

All of this for **£949**!!
