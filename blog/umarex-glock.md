# **Umarex Glock Co2 Pistols**

Used worldwide by law enforcement and military, the Glock pistol is one of the best selling handguns ever produced. Umarex faithfully reproduced these guns for the airgun market and we have a range of these guns to offer.

## **Umarex Glock 17**

This is the grandfather of the Glock pistols, the model that came at the very start. The original fired 9 mm rounds, and the licensed replica, which shoots both 4.5 mm pellets and steel BBs with a muzzle energy of about three joules, promises alot of fun. 

The metal slide is visually impressive and gives the gun its remarkable weight. The blowback on some models makes every shot feel like the real thing, and with its rifled barrel the Glock 17 delivers impressive precision.

**In store you can find both the Gen 4 & 5 but what's the difference?**

The most noticeable change on the Gen 5 can be found on the grip, the finger grooves which were first introduced on the Gen 3 are missing. The front part of the slide and body have been tapered to make holstering a doddle, that's right the brick has curves. The sight is 3 dot rather than the U shape found on the 4th Gen and the 5th Generation is slightly lighter and shorter as evident in the specs below. A spring loaded mag dropout mechanism has been included on the Gen 5 whereas the Gen 4 relies on gravity for removal.

Also available in the glock 17 range is the Dual Ammo. The dual-ammo model provides the ability to shoot both BB's and pellets as you would expect. A handy feature of this model is the magazine, which provides you with storage for 3 rotary clips plus 1. One clip for BB's and the other 3 for pellets. There is no lock open on the slider with this model though so you will have to keep count of your shots. Specs for the 3 versions below.

## **Umarex Glock 19**

The CO₂ replica of the GLOCK 19 is compact and handy, with the unmistakable look of the original pistol and plenty of power. In spite of its relatively small length of 186 mm, it fires 4.5-mm steel BBs with a muzzle energy of up to 3 joules and weighs a hefty 717 g. Like the original, it has a metal slide and a real trigger blade safety.

The first thing that you notice about this gun is how small it is, as you would expect with a glock the top is metal and the bottom is ballistic plastic. The gun features white U and dot sights. 

This is a low cost authentic replica that provides good accuracy and value for money.

The other Glock 19, the Glock 19X is everything you would expect from a Glock replica much like the other models discussed above. the first thing that sets is apart from the rest is clearly the colour, described by Umarex as Coyote. The 19X combines the frame of the G17 with the slide of the smaller G19, features lock open and blowback. This model also features the 3 dot sights instead of the U shaped found on other models.

    
**Glock 19**
- 186mm
- 717g
- 16 shot .177 BB
- Smooth Bore
