# ***Umarex Legends M1A1***

From Â£320 In-Store

This, the semi-auto Umarex Legends M1A1, is a faithful replica of the historic and popular Tommy Gun. The M1A1 has got to be one of the coolest replicas to be made so far and is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser.

The M1A1 is powered by two 12g CO2 capsules, blow-back action, and a high capacity magazine that holds 30 4.5mm BBs. Be sure to stock up on BB's and CO2 for this one.

The gun features a worn finish and and an all metal design, other than the stock and pistol grip which are plastic. 

Barrel lengths are 300mm, and the overall length of the Umarex is 808mm, just 2mm shorter than the original. 

Weighing in at a hefty 7.75lbs, although as expected is lighter than the original, the gun stil has a good weight to it. 

The overall finish, as can be expected from Umarex replicas, is great with all mechanical parts machined well and operating smoothly.

Another great Legends product from Umarex, maybe even the best one so far.
