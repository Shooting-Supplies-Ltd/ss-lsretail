With excellent accuracy and consistency, there is plenty of fun to be had with this gun, it is ideal as a backyard plinker and can be used to deal with small vermin.

One unique feature of the Umarex Ruger 10/22 Air Rifle is the trigger. The 10/22 has a 10 lb double-action pull, but cocking the charging handle on the rifle turns it into a single action trigger and reduces the weight to 3 lbs.

The Umarex Ruger 10/22 Air Rifle is a lightweight and authentic replica of the original and is likely to garner a significant fan base included both new and experienced shooters.
